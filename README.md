# Hello There 👋

I am Officer K. I try to learn something new from the FOSS community every day. For me it is very important to be independent, especially from big companies. I've been working with Linux on and off for a few years now, have learned a lot of things and will definitely learn more.

My main focus at the moment is:

- Linux General
- Automations
- Virtualizations

Feel free to show me new things!
