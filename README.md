# Hello There 👋

I am Officer K. I try to learn new stuff from the FOSS community every day. For me it is very important to be independent, especially from big companies. I've been working with Linux on and off for a few years now, have learned a lot of things and will definitely learn more.

My main focus at the moment is:

- Linux in General
- Automations
- Virtualizations

Feel free to show me new software, hardware stuff or let us together work on a new project!
