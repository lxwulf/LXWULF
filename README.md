# Hello There üëã

I am Officer K.

I try to learn new stuff from the FOSS community every day. For me it is very important to be independent, especially from big companies.
I've been working with Linux on and off for a few years now, have learned a lot of things and will definitely learn more.

My main focus at the moment is:

- Linux in General
- Automation with Ansible
- Virtualization with QEMU/KVM
- Testing different Open Source Software

Besides that I'm experimenting with various other things like Android rooting, raspberry pi projects, hacking - yes also security related but also in terms of using things they weren't made for - and also programming. At the moment I am learning Python.

Feel free to show me new software, hardware stuff or let us together work on a new project!

For more experiments and background storys look around on my new [Website](https://cloudwulf.cf)
